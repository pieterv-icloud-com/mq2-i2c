# mq2-i2c

Will act as a mq2 i2c slave device.

Basing a lot of the work on these:

I have an Adafruit Trinket M0 for this project, so I will be implementing this in CircuitPython as a first try.

So i2cslave is not supported on the Trinket due to space constraints, could try and build from source:
